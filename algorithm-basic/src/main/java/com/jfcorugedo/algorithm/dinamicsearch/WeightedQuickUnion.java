/**
 * <p>
 * This is a implementation of quick-union algorithm using an improvement called Weighted
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Whenever a connected components (trees) must be merged into another, it takes into account
 * the number of object of each tree, so always the smaller tree will be linked to the larger one
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It tries to avoid very tall trees to improve performance
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <img src="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf/images/weighted-quick-union-overview.png" />
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When joining two trees of equal size, this weighted quick union convention is to
 * make the root of the second tree point to the root of the first tree. Also, this weighted
 * quick union algorithm performs union by size (number of nodes) -  not union by height -
 * and does not do path compression.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To implement this approach, there will be two different arrays, one stores the root of each segment
 * and the other one stores the length associated with each root. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example: This array represents five elements without any connection (each element is its own root)
 * </p>
 * <pre> 
 * tree=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * And this other array represents the length of each tree. Because there's not connections, each tree has a length of one
 * </p>
 * <pre> 
 * treesSize=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * After executing this operation: union(2,3), the root of the third element will be connected to the root of the
 * second element.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * tree=[0, 1, 2, 2, 4]
 * treesSize=[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]
 * </pre>
 * This approach adds some overhead to union method but it drastically improves the performance of
 * find method, because the depth of any node x is at most log2 N.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>The size of the tree containing x at least doubles since |T 2| â‰¥ |T 1|.</li>
 * <li>Size of tree containing x can double at most lg N times</li>
 * </ul>
 * Because 2^(log2 N) * 1 = N that the max number of nodes in the tree
 * 
 * <p>
